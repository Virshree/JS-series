//DOM is Document Object Model

// It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content

//The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, 
//programming languages can interact with the page.


//DOM manipulation is when you use JavaScript to add,remove, and modify elements of a website
